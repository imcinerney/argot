# argot
argot tries to solve the problem of looking up a word and forgetting it 20 minutes later, by having your dictionary keep track of words you searched. Users can create lists for different works they are reading or just keep one for all the words they are unfamilar with. Eventually, argot will offer a number of games to test user's knowledge of words in their lists, with the goal of helping people increase their vocabulary through targeted testing.
